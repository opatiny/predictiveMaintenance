# Predictive maintenance project

## Context

Use warm-up data of micro5 milling machines in order to identify the current machine, and create a transformation matrix to adapt tools to the given machine.

## Objectives

1. Cluster data in order to attribute new data to the correct machine
2. Create a transformation matrix in order to normalize a machines data into a reference framework
